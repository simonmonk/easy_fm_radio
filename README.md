# Easy FM Radio

The design files and firmware for my project to build an FM broadcast receiver with the design goals of bing easy to use for someone with dementia or limited dexterity.

At present, there is just a design for a PCB FM Antenna copied from this [research publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277016433_A_Compact_Printed_Spiral_FM_Antenna)

I have yet to try it out. Watch out for updates.

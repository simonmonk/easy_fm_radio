# Easy FM Radio

The design files and firmware for my project to build an FM broadcast receiver with the design goals of bing easy to use for someone with dementia or limited dexterity.

At present, there is just a design for a PCB FM Antenna copied from this [research publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277016433_A_Compact_Printed_Spiral_FM_Antenna)

Good instructions and code here for [getting the RDA5807M FM Receiver working with Arduino.](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Based-Digital-Audio-FM-Radio-Using-RDA5807/)

You can follow on with the development of this project and find more explanation at the links below.
